# PUB-SUB & Streams in REDIS

To simulate a chat application using PUB_SUB, <br><br>
-> Create a Database on Cloud (<a href="https://upstash.com"/> Upstash </a> will get the work done)<br><br>
-> Connect to the database via **Redis**<br><br>
-> Publish a channel on that database and Subscribe to it as well to see the published messages.<br><br>

And, we're done!
